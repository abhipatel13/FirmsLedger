        <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Traditional HR teams often lack the specialized knowledge to verify clinical credentials, check NMC/MCI registrations, or assess ACLS/BLS certifications. Healthcare staffing agencies fill this gap — offering pre-vetted, compliant talent within weeks, not months. In Ahmedabad&apos;s competitive medical talent market, the right staffing partner can make or break a hospital&apos;s operational efficiency.

        <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Not all staffing agencies are equal. When evaluating a partner for healthcare recruitment in Ahmedabad, consider these key criteria:
        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-0 border-t border-slate-200">
          <li className="py-4 border-b border-slate-200 pl-8 relative text-slate-700 text-base before:content-['→'] before:absolute before:left-0 before:text-orange-500 before:font-semibold">
            <strong className="text-slate-900">Healthcare Specialization:</strong> Choose an agency that exclusively or primarily works in healthcare — not a general staffing firm dabbling in medical roles.
          </li>
          <li className="py-4 border-b border-slate-200 pl-8 relative text-slate-700 text-base before:content-['→'] before:absolute before:left-0 before:text-orange-500 before:font-semibold">
            <strong className="text-slate-900">Credential Verification Process:</strong> Ask specifically how they verify NMC/MCI registration, ACLS/BLS certifications, and conduct background checks.
          </li>
          <li className="py-4 border-b border-slate-200 pl-8 relative text-slate-700 text-base before:content-['→'] before:absolute before:left-0 before:text-orange-500 before:font-semibold">
            <strong className="text-slate-900">Local Gujarat Network:</strong> Agencies with deep local ties can source passive candidates from Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat, and Vadodara — giving you a wider talent pool.

            <strong className="text-slate-900">Flexible Engagement Models:</strong> Ensure they offer contract, temp-to-perm, and permanent hiring — so you can scale staffing up or down with patient volumes.

        <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Ahmedabad&apos;s Civil Hospital — treating over 1.3 million patients and performing nearly 80,000 surgeries annually — is just the tip of the iceberg. The city is home to a dense network of private hospitals, diagnostic chains, specialty clinics, and pharmaceutical companies, all competing for the same limited pool of skilled medical talent.
        </p>
        <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-12">
          The Gujarat government&apos;s push to expand healthcare infrastructure — including proposed expansions at Civil Hospital that would make it the world&apos;s largest hospital — signals that the demand for healthcare talent will only intensify over the next few years. For HR managers and hospital administrators, building relationships with reliable staffing agencies now is not just smart — it&apos;s essential.
